Welcome to Tensor4all!

## Julia libraries
We provide various Julia libraries that are useful for applying tensor networks beyond the conventional target, i.e., wavefunctions.

### For users
#### Tutorials
* [T4F examples](https://tensors4fields.gitlab.io/T4FExamples) provides a comprehensive set of tutorials on using TCI and quantics representations.

#### Online manual
* [TensorCrossInterpolation.jl](https://github.com/tensor4all/TensorCrossInterpolation.jl) provides implementations of TCI.
* [QuanticsGrids.jl](https://github.com/tensor4all/QuanticsGrids.jl) provides utilities for handing quantics representations, e.g., creating a quantics grid and transformation between the original coordinate system and the quantics representation.
* [QuanticsTCI.jl]([l](https://github.com/tensor4all/QuanticsTCI.jl) is a thin wrapper around `TensorCrossInterpolation.jl` and `QuanticsGrids.jl`, providing valuable functionalities for non-expert users' performing quantics TCI (QTCI).


### For developers & internal users
Private repositories are still hosted on GitLab.
